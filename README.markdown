Tricklr
=======

I am a python programmer by profession, but I rarely write python outside work,
and I realised that I miss out on some of the cool stuff going on in the
community because of that, so this project is an effort to learn about some things.

Tricklr is an attempt to implement Rands' [Trickle List](http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2008/08/18/the_trickle_list.html) in a webapp.  I thought it'd be a fun project.

Nosy script included in script/test, pip requirements in REQUIREMENTS.

Cool stuff I'm playing with:
----------------------------

virtualenv
pip
django
